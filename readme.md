*Problem Statement-1 :- Waste Type Detector*

As Indore is the cleanest city in India, It is the responsibility of all citizens of Indore to maintain the cleanliness of the city.
Keeping different types of waste in different garbage boxes is a good practice but sometimes due to lack of awareness we don't know
the type of certain type of garbage. Here we are referring solid & dry as different types of garbage. We need to develop an application
which scans the garbage and determine its type also it should educate users about the type of garbage. Solution list & learning module
should be progressive in nature i.e. it should update its dictionary or knowledge about different types after every scan.

DATA SET: Collected by images of spoiled fruits images and solid waste data available on kaggle and images of food on ImageNet.
